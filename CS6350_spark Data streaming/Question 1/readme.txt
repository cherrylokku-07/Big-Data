Creating a Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Spark Streaming, ELK Stack, and NewsAPI

Setting up this project involves creating a live data processing flow using Kafka, Spark Streaming, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and NewsAPI as the data origin. The pipeline acquires news data from NewsAPI, employs Spark Streaming for real-time processing, stores outcomes in Elasticsearch, and visualizes the data via Kibana.

Initial Setup
1. Install Kafka 3.5.1 from https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/ and adhere to installation guidelines.
2. Commence Zookeeper and Kafka Server from their respective directories.
3. Create two Kafka topics: 'topic1-events' and 'topic2-events'.
4. Download and Install Elasticsearch and Kibana, configuring Kibana's 'kibana.yml' file to set the Elasticsearch host.
5. Start Elasticsearch and Logstash after appropriate setup.
6. Install necessary Python dependencies like 'pyspark'.
7. Download and Install Apache Spark; create a checkpoint directory in the Spark files' location.

Data Ingestion and Processing
1. Define API, search terms, and port in 'support.py'.
2. Run 'newclient.py' to obtain data from NewsAPI and publish it to 'topic1-events'.
3. Use 'consumer.py' via 'spark-submit' to process data in real-time and send results to 'topic2-events'.

Visualizing Data with Kibana
1. Access Kibana at http://localhost:5601/.
2. Configure an Index Pattern in Kibana's 'Management' to view 'topic2-events*' data.
3. Create visualizations on the dashboard based on processed data, such as a bar chart for top 10 named entities.
4. Observe real-time data updates in visualizations; modify the time range for different intervals.
5. Save the dashboard once satisfied with the visualizations.

With this setup, you've established a real-time data processing pipeline using Kafka, Spark Streaming, and the ELK stack. This enables the monitoring and analysis of news data in real-time.
